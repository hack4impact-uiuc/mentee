| | Happy Monday! This week, we‚Äôre digging into the bottleneck defining the AI boom: power. Google just scaled demand response across its AI data centers, Equinix locked in 1GW of advanced nuclear, and developers everywhere are scrambling for electrons before they pour concrete. We cut through the hype in our new [_Data Center Powering Models_ report](https://www.ctvc.co/r/38bbf877?m=70f92015-76dc-4859-9540-d7b1cc2db144), out now. In other news, the Treasury drops new guidance on solar & wind tax credits, DOE fast-tracks nuclear pilots, and CATL pauses operations at a lithium mine that feeds 6% of global supply.In deals, $325m for sustainable data center development, $250m for renewable energy projects, and $235m for eVTOLs.**Plus, ICYMI, our CTVC x New York Climate Week tracker is** [**here**](https://www.ctvc.co/r/57a27f40?m=70f92015-76dc-4859-9540-d7b1cc2db144)**!** Check it out, and keep submitting events to us to include [here](https://www.ctvc.co/r/93472ead?m=70f92015-76dc-4859-9540-d7b1cc2db144).

Developers are scrambling for solutions.Earlier this month, Google [became](https://www.ctvc.co/r/996d1ac9?m=70f92015-76dc-4859-9540-d7b1cc2db144) the first major tech company to scale demand response across its AI data centers, dialing back usage during peak stress events to help stabilize the grid. Meanwhile, last week, data center giant Equinix [signed](https://www.ctvc.co/r/a5d6bdb6?m=70f92015-76dc-4859-9540-d7b1cc2db144) agreements with three advanced nuclear developers (Radiant, ULC-Energy, and Stellaria), bringing its nuclear pipeline to over 1GW.Advanced tech partnerships, grid deals, and flexible AI loads are just a few of the strategies emerging to get power online _fast_. But with projections diverging wildly and press releases outpacing reality, we wanted to cut through the noise. So in CTVC/Sightline Climate fashion, we built the dataset we wished existed: tracking who‚Äôs building what, where, and how they plan to power it. The result is our new [**Data Center Powering Models report**](https://www.ctvc.co/r/82a19035?m=70f92015-76dc-4859-9540-d7b1cc2db144) ‚Äî part of our full Sightline client coverage of data centers, tariffs, supply contracts, and cost benchmarks.[Get the report now](https://www.ctvc.co/r/9ed7e2ca?m=70f92015-76dc-4859-9540-d7b1cc2db144)Sightline clients can access the [full data center coverage](https://www.ctvc.co/r/e5eb8f00?m=70f92015-76dc-4859-9540-d7b1cc2db144) and [report here](https://www.ctvc.co/r/b5b399f4?m=70f92015-76dc-4859-9540-d7b1cc2db144).

Data centers once measured in tens of megawatts are now being announced at the gigawatt scale; larger than power plants themselves. Development is increasingly power-first, but faces on-the-ground constraints: multi-year interconnection delays, decade-long clean energy project timelines, and rising electricity costs. That means new procurement strategies, novel tariffs, and entirely new infrastructure plays are becoming strategic differentiators.Earlier this month, we released our [**Data Center Powering Model report**](https://www.ctvc.co/r/75c3c855?m=70f92015-76dc-4859-9540-d7b1cc2db144), mapping the six powering models actually being deployed ‚Äî from grid-tied clean to RNG microgrids ‚Äî and lays out the trade-offs in cost, speed, emissions, and scalability. As we‚Äôre showing below, excess existing generation is one of the fastest ways to get power, but it‚Äôs also restrictive. Data centers need to be scaled to meet the power, not the other way around. Backup power can act as a ‚Äòbridging‚Äô solution, but it‚Äôs expensive. Renewable microgrids seem great, but they‚Äôre tough to balance if totally disconnected from the grid. At the other end of the spectrum, we‚Äôve seen some hyperscalers investing in SMRs (like Equinix), in the hopes that one day powering a data center will be as simple as building a tiny nuclear power plant next to it. ![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXelUI1tl3P6zE6Xg47DX_lCtTRs8Qiu7J_MqeKTuRdHgucz4pJ4KFAymNx5x1Qp8QNUUs-3VToEE9dX8lugPGGh3gucExNsyZlqY3p0pZDyDvnBTPwhGdt4wLlYr9YBreVxdHmyzQ?key=heAqyZzMb_Qzc2pKlaoUNQ)Source: Sightline ClimateWe also dive into the economics: who‚Äôs paying for grid upgrades, how tariffs are evolving, and where developers are stepping in to fund their own generation. Case studies across the US and Europe show how different markets are handling the crunch ‚Äî from Nevada‚Äôs clean transition tariffs to Dublin‚Äôs requirement for on-site backup to spots where extra capacity is attracting developers.Why it mattersThe winners in this race won‚Äôt be the ones with the splashiest announcements, but the ones that can lock in reliable, affordable, and scalable power ahead of the curve. With many new announcements topping 1GW and carrying a median $800m price tag, these builds are large enough to reshape entire regional power markets, forcing utilities, regulators, and communities to rethink how new infrastructure gets placed and priced.That‚Äôs where our approach is different. Most datasets stop at forecasts ‚Äî sweeping top-down projections of where demand might go. We‚Äôve gone bottom-up, building a project-level pipeline of nearly 300 announced sites totaling 73.6GW, with details on how each center plans to power itself:**Primary power source**: grid-tied, onsite solar, wind, SMRs, gas, hydrogen**Backup generation**: RNG turbines, hydrogen fuel cells**Battery systems**: lithium-ion, flow, emerging chemistries**Cooling tech**: liquid, advanced liquid, rare advanced air-cooled setups**Heat recycling**: whether waste heat is being looped into district networks![](https://www.ctvc.co/content/images/size/w1600/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-18-at-5.41.43---PM.png)Source: Sightline ClimateIt‚Äôs not just about location and size. This granularity matters because all these moving parts of powering models determine cost, emissions, and whether projects actually break ground. The actionable dataset shows where equipment manufacturers and utilities can find clients, and where novel tech is being deployed. It also reveals the results of policy and regional dynamics that shape how tech gets deployed. Our [**Data Center Powering Models**](https://www.ctvc.co/r/6f86d35a?m=70f92015-76dc-4859-9540-d7b1cc2db144)report aims to surface the real demand signals that utilities, developers, and investors are trying to plan around.What‚Äôs next**Geography matters more than ever.** Communities with spare capacity ‚Äî or political will to fast-track it ‚Äî are the favorite picks for developers looking to move as fast as possible. Think rural Virginia, West Texas, and parts of the Nordics.**Power will become a competitive moat.** Expect to see more developers securing their own generation (gas, nuclear, or clean firm), reviving shuttered coal plant interconnects, or cutting bespoke deals with utilities to skip the line. Still, they‚Äôll need to be good corporate neighbors to keep local communities on their side.**Sightline will keep tracking it.** We‚Äôre constantly expanding our dataset and coverage of data centers ‚Äî including project timelines, supply contracts, tariff structures, and tech stacks. Data centers are already one of the defining energy stories of the decade, and it‚Äôs still being written.[Download the report here](https://www.ctvc.co/r/99801b65?m=70f92015-76dc-4859-9540-d7b1cc2db144) **Deals of the Week (8/11‚Äì8/17)** **Late-Stage / Growth**üè† **Aira**, a Stockholm, Sweden-based residential heat pump manufacturer and energy platform, [raised](https://www.ctvc.co/r/007238d3?m=70f92015-76dc-4859-9540-d7b1cc2db144) **$174m** of Growth funding from Altor, Kallsk√§r, Kinnevik, Lingotto, and Temasek Holdings.‚ö° **Green Genius**, a Vilnius, Lithuania-based solar-plus-storage project developer, [raised](https://www.ctvc.co/r/893cb36f?m=70f92015-76dc-4859-9540-d7b1cc2db144) **$75m** of PF Debt funding from Nord/LB and Nordic Investment Bank (NIB).**Early-Stage**‚öíÔ∏è **Vulcan Elements**, a Durham, NC-based rare earth magnets manufacturer, [raised](https://www.ctvc.co/r/7a6d2f78?m=70f92015-76dc-4859-9540-d7b1cc2db144) **$65m** of Series A funding from Altimeter and One Investment Management (OneIM).‚ö° **National Renewable Network**, a Sydney, Australia-based network of solar and storage systems, [raised](https://www.ctvc.co/r/b0d7cf10?m=70f92015-76dc-4859-9540-d7b1cc2db144) **$44m** of Series A funding from Ecotone Partners, Electrifi Ventures, Infradebt, Investible, and Virescent Ventures.üõµ **Ultraviolette Automotive**, a Bengaluru, India-based electric motorcycle manufacturer, [raised](https://www.ctvc.co/r/45c1ae64?m=70f92015-76dc-4859-9540-d7b1cc2db144) **$21m** of Corporate Strategic funding from TDK Ventures.üí® **Equatic**, a Santa Monica, CA-based carbon removal developer, [raised](https://www.ctvc.co/r/79abff5b?m=70f92015-76dc-4859-9540-d7b1cc2db144) **$12m** of Series A funding from Temasek Trust and Kibo Invest.üåæ **Saga Robotics**, an Oslo, Norway-based developer of autonomous robots for agriculture, [raised](https://www.ctvc.co/r/be0c1716?m=70f92015-76dc-4859-9540-d7b1cc2db144) **$11m** of Seed funding from Aker Carbon Capture, Blystad, Hatteland, MP Pensjon, Melesio, and other investors. üîã **3DC**, a Sendai, Japan-based developer of graphene materials for energy storage, [raised](https://www.ctvc.co/r/3963686d?m=70f92015-76dc-4859-9540-d7b1cc2db144) **$9m** of Series A funding from ANRI, 77 Capital, KSP, Kyoritsu, Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Venture Capital (MSIVC), Mitsubishi UFJ Capital, and other investors.ü•© **Prefer**, a Singapore-based bean-free coffee producer, [raised](https://www.ctvc.co/r/e37311e7?m=70f92015-76dc-4859-9540-d7b1cc2db144) **$4m** of Seed funding from At One Ventures, Chancery Hill Capital, and Forge Ventures. üõ∞ **Manastu Space**, a Mumbai, India-based green propulsion systems developer, [raised](https://www.ctvc.co/r/83cf5c65?m=70f92015-76dc-4859-9540-d7b1cc2db144) **$3m** of Series A funding from Capital-A, Bhagnani family office, Capital 2B, E2MC, and Indian Angel Network.**Other**üè† **Evolution Data Centres**, a Singapore-based sustainable data center infrastructure developer, [raised](https://www.ctvc.co/r/c4e76fce?m=70f92015-76dc-4859-9540-d7b1cc2db144) **$325m** of PE Expansion funding from Warburg Pincus and Zero Two.‚ö° **United Solar Group**, a Dubai, United Arab Emirates-based renewable energy project developer, [raised](https://www.ctvc.co/r/61f1c057?m=70f92015-76dc-4859-9540-d7b1cc2db144) **$250m** of PF Debt funding from International Finance Corporation.‚úàÔ∏è **Eve Air Mobility**, a S√£o Paulo, Brazil-based eVTOL developer, [raised](https://www.ctvc.co/r/fe093ab8?m=70f92015-76dc-4859-9540-d7b1cc2db144) **$230m** of Post-IPO Equity funding from Brazilian Development Bank (BNDES) and Embraer.**Exits**üåæ **AcreTrader**, a Fayetteville, AR-based farmland investment online platform, [was acquired by](https://www.ctvc.co/r/c66d6a36?m=70f92015-76dc-4859-9540-d7b1cc2db144) Proterra Investment Partners for **an undisclosed amoun**t.ü•© **Daring Foods**, a Los Angeles, CA-based plant-based chicken developer, [was acquired by](https://www.ctvc.co/r/150b6c0b?m=70f92015-76dc-4859-9540-d7b1cc2db144) v2food for **an undisclosed amount**.üè≠ **Kelvion**, a Herne, Germany-based energy-efficient thermal management solutions provider, [was acquired by](https://www.ctvc.co/r/487d1512?m=70f92015-76dc-4859-9540-d7b1cc2db144) Apollo for an **undisclosed amount**.**This is a sample of the deals available for Sightline Climate clients.
