# Flask Backend

This is based off of [Flask Boilerplate](https://github.com/tko22/flask-boilerplate), but repurposed for MongoDB using MongoEngine.

We use [black](https://github.com/ambv/black) for code formatting, and [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/) for optional static typing.

## Remote Database Setup

Create a `.env` file in this folder with the contents:

```
MONGO_USER=[DB username]
MONGO_PASSWORD=[DB password]
MONGO_DB=mentee
MONGO_HOST=[host uri]
```

Replace the `[xxx]` with your own credentials.

### Server Setup

Make sure you have [Python3](https://realpython.com/installing-python/) and [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) installed.

Install packages:

```
$ poetry install
```

To run the server:

```
$ poetry run start
```

### Verifying

Install [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/) or your app of choice for testing API calls, or go onto "collections" on MongoDB Atlas

Then, make Postman calls to verify that the server works:

`GET localhost:5000/api/mentors` should return a list of the test mentors we have in the DB.

You can also view the contents of your database by connecting to it in Mongo Compass using the default settings!

## Repository Contents

- `api/views/` - Holds files that define your endpoints
- `api/models/` - Holds files that defines your database schema
- `api/__init__.py` - What is initially ran when you start your application
- `api/utils.py` - utility functions and classes - explained [here](https://github.com/tko22/flask-boilerplate/wiki/Conventions)
- `api/core.py` - includes core functionality including error handlers and logger
- `tests/` - Folder holding tests

#### Others

- `config.py` - Provides Configuration for the application. There are two configurations: one for development and one for production using Heroku.
- `manage.py` - Command line interface that allows you to perform common functions with a command
- `requirements.txt` - A list of python package dependencies the application requires
- `runtime.txt` & `Procfile` - configuration for Heroku
- `Dockerfile` - instructions for Docker to build the Flask app
- `docker-compose.yml` - config to setup this Flask app and a Database
- `migrations/` - Holds migration files â€“ doesn't exist until you `python manage.py db init` if you decide to not use docker

### MISC

If you're annoyed by the **pycache** files

```
find . | grep -E "(__pycache__|\.pyc|\.pyo$)" | xargs rm -rf
```
